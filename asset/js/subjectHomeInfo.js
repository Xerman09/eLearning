        description : '&emsp; &emsp; Differential Equations is a branch of mathematics that deals with equations involving derivatives, which describe how a quantity changes with respect to another. These equations express relationships between a function and its derivatives, and are fundamental in modeling a wide range of real-world phenomena such as population growth, heat transfer, electrical circuits, and motion. Differential equations are classified into two main types: ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which involve derivatives with respect to a single variable, and partial differential equations (PDEs), which involve derivatives with respect to multiple variables. Solving differential equations involves finding functions that satisfy the given relationships, and these solutions provide insights into dynamic systems in fields like physics, engineering, biology, and economics.',
